# AI Features Summary

## 🧠 ADAPTIVE LEARNING

### What It Does
**Adaptive Learning automatically adjusts question difficulty to match your skill level in real-time.**

### How It Works

1. **Calculates Your Level** (1-10 scale)
   - Analyzes your last 5 practice test scores
   - Considers consistency (are scores stable or varying?)
   - Tracks improvement trend (getting better or worse?)
   - **Example:** If you average 75% with consistent scores, you're at Level 5-6 (Intermediate)

2. **Selects Matching Questions**
   - **Beginner (Level 1-3):** Only easy questions
   - **Intermediate (Level 4-6):** 40% easy + 60% medium questions
   - **Advanced (Level 7-8):** 50% medium + 50% hard questions
   - **Expert (Level 9-10):** Only hard questions

3. **Prioritizes Weak Areas**
   - If you have weak topics (score < 60%), 60% of questions come from those areas
   - Ensures you practice what you need most

4. **Adjusts After Each Answer**
   - **Correct + Fast:** Difficulty increases slightly (you're ready for harder)
   - **Correct + Slow:** No change (you got it but took time)
   - **Wrong:** Difficulty decreases (you need easier questions)
   - **Considers question difficulty:** Hard questions have more impact on adjustment

### Result
- You never get bored (too easy) or frustrated (too hard)
- Questions match your current skill level
- Weak areas get more practice automatically
- Difficulty adapts as you improve

## 🎯 DYNAMIC MOCK EXAMS

### What It Does
**Dynamic Mock Exams generate personalized practice exams that focus on your weak areas while maintaining the official CBR exam format.**

### How It Works

1. **Analyzes Your Performance**
   - Identifies weak areas (topics with score < 60%)
   - Calculates "urgency" score:
     - Lower score = more urgent
     - Declining trend = more urgent
     - High variance = more urgent
   - Sorts by urgency (worst areas first)

2. **Selects Questions from Weak Areas**
   - **70% of questions** come from your weakest area (if only 1 weak area)
   - **60% of questions** come from weak areas (if 2-3 weak areas)
   - **50% of questions** come from weak areas (if 4+ weak areas)
   - Questions are **weighted by mastery**: Lower mastery = higher priority

3. **Prevents Repeats**
   - Tracks all questions you've seen in previous mock exams
   - Filters them out automatically
   - Every mock exam is unique

4. **Maintains CBR Structure**
   - **Always 50 questions total:** 30 regular + 20 image questions
   - **30 minutes time limit**
   - **88% pass rate** (44 correct answers needed)
   - Structure never changes, only question selection

5. **Ensures Theme Diversity**
   - All 15 major CBR themes are represented in every exam:
     - Hazard Perception, Priority Rules, Speed Limits
     - Traffic Lights, Traffic Signs, Road Markings
     - Roundabout Rules, Overtaking, Pedestrian Crossings
     - Construction Zones, Weather Conditions, etc.
   - Even while focusing on weak areas, all themes are covered

6. **Adjusts Difficulty**
   - Considers your recent performance
   - If improving: slightly harder questions
   - If declining: slightly easier questions
   - Maintains CBR structure during adjustment

### Result
- Every mock exam is personalized to your needs
- Focuses on areas where you need the most practice
- No repeated questions across exams
- Maintains official CBR format (50 questions, 30 min, 88% pass)
- All official themes are covered

## 🔄 HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER

1. **Practice Tests** use **Adaptive Learning**
   - Questions adjust to your level
   - Weak areas get prioritized
   - Difficulty adapts in real-time

2. **Performance Data** feeds into **Dynamic Mock Exams**
   - Your practice test results identify weak areas
   - Mock exams then focus on those weak areas
   - Creates a personalized learning path

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - As you improve in practice tests, mock exams get harder
   - As weak areas become strong, new weak areas are identified
   - The system adapts to your progress
